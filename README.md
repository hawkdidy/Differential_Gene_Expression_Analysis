#Differential Gene Expression Anaylsis 
This repository will be where I post the scripts from my thesis work. I will be trying to find differentially
expressed genes in the human immune system when the people are subjected to space like environments. I hope it
can also serve as a guide for people who are just getting started in DEG of microarrays.

As of now you will find all R scripts under the [pipline folder](Differential_Gene_Expression_Analysis/Pipeline/). I am possibly going to use th rpy2 package to use python together with R and then use a jupyter notebook. That is what I am currently working on.
